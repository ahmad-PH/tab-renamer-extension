        <h1>What's New</h1>

        <h2>[1.1.3] - 2025-02-23</h2>

        <h3>Fixed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>üîë <strong>Complete Fix for Keystroke Registration</strong>: Fully resolved the issue with keystrokes sometimes not being captured while typing in the tab rename box. This builds on the partial fix from v1.1.2 and should now work reliably across all websites.
                <blockquote>Technical side-note: The issue was caused by certain websites implementing aggressive global event listeners that interfered with input handling. The fix completely isolates the extension's UI within an iframe, preventing external event manipulation.</blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>[1.1.2] - 2025-02-23</h2>

        <h3>Added</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>üåü <strong>Twemoji style for emojis</strong>: You can now select between the native (system) style and the twemoji style for your emojis. Mac users will have native as their default settings and users on other platforms will have Twemoji as the default. This, together with some other fixes, (see below) should hopefully improve the emoji-selection experience for non-mac users. To change this style yourself you can go to the setting page, available through the extension "options" page. This is also accessible through a gear icon in the rename overlay.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fixed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An issue with the rendering of the native style emojis on Windows causing them not to be appropriately centered in their places in the emoji picker.</li>
            <li>Partially fixed keystores not being captured appropriately while typing the tab name in some webpages. More fixes to come.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>[1.0.1] - 2024-06-09</h2>

        <h3>Fixed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Resolved an issue where the extension would not correctly load stored names and favicons after a Chrome update.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>[1.0.0] - 2024-05-13</h2>

        <h3>Initial Release</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First public release of the extension.</li>
