- This is a Chrome Extension project, that lets users rename and change the favicon of their tabs. It has a service worker handling the central opertaions, and a contentScript containing the UI.

- I have unit tests in pure JS, and end-to-end browser tests that load the extension into the browser and run browser tests with Playwright. (I used to use Selenium)

- Do NOT write documentation comments (JSDoc or TSDoc). I will ask for them if I need them.

- Always prefer static ESM (Ecmascript Modules) imports over the others. Only use other forms if absolutely necessary.

- When running end-to-end (e2e) playwright tests, usually you don't need to run `npm run dev` since I'm already running that in the background.

- To search for datadog logs, use `uv run scripts/datadog.py`. Use --help to see how to use it.

- When designing new pages, look at shared.css for style-related standards. (Colors, fonts, etc.)
