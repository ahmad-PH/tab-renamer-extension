- This is a Chrome Extension project, that lets users rename and change the favicon of their tabs. It has a service worker handling the central opertaions, and a contentScript containing the UI.

- I have unit tests in pure JS, and end-to-end browser tests that load the extension into the browser and run browser tests with Playwright. (I used to use Selenium)
