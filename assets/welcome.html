        <h1>Welcome to Tab Renamer!</h1>
        <p class="highlight">Customize your tab titles and favicons for a more organized browsing experience.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> ‚úèÔ∏è Tab Renaming:</strong> Open a dialog to rename any tab with a simple keyboard shortcut.</li>
                <li><strong> üé® Favicon Customization with Emojis:</strong> Choose from a wide range of emojis using the built-in emoji picker to replace each tab's favicon, adding a custom visual element to each tab to make them more distinguishable.</li>
                <li><strong> üîÑ Persistent Names:</strong> Your custom tab names and favicons are stored and will be preserved even when you close and reopen the tabs or even the entire window.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How to Use</h2>

            <p> After installation, first, you will need to refresh any tabs that 
                were already open if you want to use the extension in them
                <span class="asterisk"><a href="#explanation">*</a></span>.
            Then, you have three different ways to activate the extension on a page:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keyboard Shortcut:</strong>
                    This is the most convenient way to use the extension. The default shortcut is <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Y</strong> or <strong>Command+Shift+Y</strong> on Mac,
                    but you should double-check because sometimes this is not set on installation as it might conflict with existing shortcuts.
                    To set the shortcut yourself, go to <strong>chrome://extensions/shortcuts</strong> and look for 'Tab Renamer'.

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Context Menu Item:</strong>
                    Right-click anywhere on a webpage and select 'Rename Tab' from the context menu.
                    Note that you should right-click inside the webpage, not on the tab itself.
                    <img src="context_menu.jpg" alt="Context Menu Item"  class="how-to-use-img" style="width:350px;">
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Action Icon:</strong>
                    Click on the extension icon under the <em>puzzle piece</em> icon to the right of the address bar.
                    If you have pinned the extension, you can directly click the extension icon on the toolbar without needing to click on the puzzle piece icon first.
                    <img src="action_icon.jpg" alt="Action Icon" class="how-to-use-img" style="width:600px;">
                </li>
            </ol>
            
        <h2>Reverting to Original Values</h2>
            <p> The user interface includes an input box to pick the new tab title, and an emoji picker to pick the new
                favicon. Leaving any of them empty will revert the corresponding value to its original state if already modified.
            </p>

            <h2>A Note from the Developer</h2>
            <p> Hi there üëã ! I'm an independent developer who created Tab Renamer because I felt renaming and changing the favicon of 
                my tabs could help me a lot in keeping my work organized. I hope you find it useful, too! </p>
            <p> Your feedback is genuinely valuable to me. If you have any suggestions, issues, or just want to share how you're using Tab Renamer,
                please don't hesitate to reach out via <a href="mailto:tabrenamer@gmail.com">email</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/_ahmad_ph_" target="_blank">X (Twitter)</a>. 
                I'll do my best to incorporate your feedback into future updates.</p>
            <p> Thank you for supporting independent developers like me, and happy browsing! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <p id="explanation"><span class="asterisk">*</span> The reason why the extension does not 
            automatically inject the content script into already-open tabs at install time is that doing
            so would require accessing broad permissions from the Chrome API (host_permissions). This would 
            present users with a potentially alarming warning telling them that the extension can read and 
            modify all their data on all open tabs. I have decided that removing this feature would be a better
            overall user experience.</p>
